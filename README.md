# optimalPurchaseSchedule
An sample solution for a category of recursive memoized problems. 

This algorithm is given an array containing the demand for a product, for each day.
The goal is to find the optimal schedule with a purchase amount for each day for the
product, given that it has cost p per unit, and that there is a storage limit of L.
At the end of each day the unsold product incurs an additional cost of e per unit.
